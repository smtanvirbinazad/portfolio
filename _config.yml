about_content: |
  I'm SM Tanvir Bin Azad, a Business Analytics student at Miami University (Class of 2026) with a passion for leveraging data and strategic insights to solve complex business challenges. My journey spans international logistics, financial analysis, and consulting, where I've developed a unique ability to bridge operational excellence with data-driven decision-making. From managing end-to-end freight operations at Union Logistics to leading award-winning consulting projects for clients like BIBIBOP Asian Grill and NextGen Fuel, I thrive in environments where analytical rigor meets real-world impact.
  
  My technical toolkit includes SQL, business intelligence platforms, and data visualization, complemented by hands-on experience in supply chain operations, market research, and financial analysis. I'm currently deepening my expertise through coursework in database systems, business intelligence, and enterprise technology, while maintaining a strong academic record on the Dean's List. Whether I'm analyzing market trends, optimizing logistics workflows, or building client relationships through strategic sales approaches, I bring a results-oriented mindset shaped by diverse international experiences across the U.S. and Myanmar.
  
  I'm actively seeking opportunities in business analytics, supply chain strategy, or financial analysis where I can apply my analytical skills and operational knowledge to drive measurable business outcomes. I'm particularly drawn to roles that combine data analysis with strategic consulting, allowing me to transform insights into actionable recommendations. If you're looking for someone who can navigate complexity, communicate effectively across teams, and deliver data-backed solutions, let's connect.
